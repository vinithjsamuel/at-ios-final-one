<p><strong>27. WAIVER</strong></p>
<div></div>
<p>Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or a delay by any party in the enforcement of any right hereunder, shall neither be construed as a continuing waiver nor create an expectation of non-enforcement of that or any other provision or right. No failure of Aesthetic Today to exercise any right or power under this Agreement or to insist upon strict compliance by a USER with any obligation or provision of this Agreement, and no custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms of this Agreement, shall constitute a waiver of Aesthetic Today’s right to demand exact compliance with this Agreement. Waiver by Aesthetic Today can be affected only in writing by an authorized officer of Aesthetic Today. Aesthetic Today’s waiver of any particular breach by a USER shall not affect or impair Aesthetic Today’s rights with respect to any subsequent breach, nor shall it affect in any way the rights or obligations of any other USER. Nor shall any delay or omission by Aesthetic Today to exercise any right arising from a breach affect or impair Aesthetic Today’s rights as to that or any subsequent breach. The existence of any claim or cause of action of a USER against Aesthetic Today shall not constitute a defence to Aesthetic Today’s enforcement of any term or provision of this Agreement.</p>
